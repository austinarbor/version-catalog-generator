=== Filtering Dependencies
If you want to exclude certain dependencies from having entries generated for them in your catalog, you can filter
dependencies either by `groupId` or by `name` (artifactId)

==== Filtering By GroupId

.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs="attributes+",role="primary"]
----
generate("myLibs") {
  // excluded for brevity
  excludeGroups = ".*spring.*" // <1>
}
----
<1> Exclude all dependencies that have "spring" in their groupId

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+",role="secondary"]
----
generator.generate("myLibs") {
  // excluded for brevity
  it.excludeGroups = ".*spring.*" // <1>
}
----
<1> Exclude all dependencies that have "spring" in their groupId

==== Filtering By Name

.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs="attributes+",role="primary"]
----
generate("myLibs") {
  // excluded for brevity
  excludeNames = ".*hibernate.*" // <1>
}
----
<1> Exclude all dependencies that have "hibernate" in their name/artifactId

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+",role="secondary"]
----
generator.generate("myLibs") {
  // excluded for brevity
  it.excludeNames = ".*hibernate.*" // <1>
}
----
<1> Exclude all dependencies that have "hibernate" in their name/artifactId
