=== Applying the Plugin

[source,kotlin,subs="attributes+"]
----
import dev.aga.gradle.versioncatalogs.Generator.generate // <1>

plugins {
  id("dev.aga.gradle.version-catalog-generator") version("{version}")
}

dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositories { // <2>
    mavenCentral()
  }
  versionCatalogs {
    generate("myLibs") {
      // excluded for brevity
    }
  }
}

<1> The extension function must be imported to allow the DSL to access the `generate` function.
Technically, the `generate` function can be placed anywhere in the settings script, but I like putting it inside the `versionCatalogs` block
since that's also where you would put `create` statements.
<2> In order for us to be able to resolve your BOM dependencies, you must specify the repositories in your settings file.
When specifying repositories in settings you can (most of the time) remove the same declarations from your build file.
According to the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sub:centralized-repository-declaration[Gradle documentation],
repositories declared in the build file will override whatever is declared in settings. This section will mostly be excluded
from subsequent code examples for brevity.

NOTE: The import statement and repository declaration blocks may be excluded from future code samples for brevity.
