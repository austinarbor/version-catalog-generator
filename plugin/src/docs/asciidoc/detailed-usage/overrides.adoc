:fn-gradle-overrides: footnote:[You can always use standard Gradle mechanisms such as resolution strategies or platforms if a property is not used to specify the version]

=== Overriding Versions
In some cases you may want to override the version specified by the BOM you are generating
the catalog from. At the current point in time, this is only possible if the BOM uses a property
to specify the version{fn-gradle-overrides}

[source,kotlin,subs="attributes+"]
----
generate("myLibs") {
  // excluded for brevity
  propertyOverrides = mapOf(
      "jackson.version" to "2.16.1", // <1>
      "aws.version" to versionRef("aws") // <2>
  )
}
----
<1> Specify a string version to use in place of all occurrences of `jackson.version` when processing the BOM
<2> Specify an existing version alias from your TOML file. The `versionRef` function
can only be used if your BOM source is a TOML (not a string dependency notation), and the version alias being
referenced _must_ exist in the same TOML file in which your BOM alias is declared.
